Intro to Game Programming - Project 1

-- Introduction --
The project is a simlulation of the Prisoner's Dilemma. More specifically, however, it is heavily based off its interpretation from the
game "Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward" called the Ambidex Game. Like in the game, the simulation provides you with two choices: Ally
or Betray. Picking one of these causes the "opponent" to randomly choose a choice, and the points are calculated as such. After any 
number of rounds, the player can SHIFT into another timeline, one where the votes haven't happened yet.

The rules for points are as follows:

If both the player and opponent pick Ally:
- Player gains 2 points
- Opponent gains 2 points

If the player picks Ally but the opponent picks Betray:
- Player loses 2 points
- Opponent gains 3 points

If the player picks Betray but the opponent picks Ally:
- Player gains 3 points
- Opponent loses 2 points

If both the player and opponent pick Betray:
- Player gains 0 points
- Opponent gains 0 points

-- UI --
In the top left corner you will find both your points and the opponent's points. Both start with 3 Bracelet Points, or BP. As stated,
you gain or lose BP based on the votes cast by you and the opponent. In the top right corner, you will see both your vote and your
opponent's vote. This updates every time the player casts a vote. Underneath the votes is a "Rules" box with a reminder for how points
are calculated. Underneath this is the Round Number, which updates with each vote. To the left of it are the "Ally" and "Betray" buttons 
to vote with, and to the right of it is the "SHIFT" button.

-- Controls --
Upon starting the game, there are three buttons. Those are the "Ally", "Betray", and "SHIFT" buttons.
- Clicking the "Ally" button will set the player's vote for that round to Ally.
- Clicking the "Betray" button will set the player's vote for that round to Betray.
After the player casts their vote, the change in points will be calculated. 
- Clicking the "SHIFT" button will reset the points, round number, and previous votes.
